Cucumber - it is a tool that supports BDD

    Given - pre condition
    When - to perform action
    And - supporting tag
    Then - expected result/outcome

Then user is navigated to dashboard page
When user clicks on PIM option

-- Cucumbers encourages code re usability concept --

main - the code we write to develop the app, we write under main

test - the code we write to test the app, we write under test

2 thing we have in every project
    - code - java
    - non java - files, properties file, excel etc.

 coding will be at one place and non java will be at another place

-- to wrote gherkin scenarios, we use features files

Valid admin login
Given user is navigated to HRMS application
When user enters admin username and password
And clicks on login button
Then admin user is successfully logged in

scenario - every scenario is considered as one test case

why we don't need system.property() - "driver/chromedriver.exe"
if the path is incorrect to webdriver - it will fail, path is limited to one machine
many time it is not compatible with browser

we use webdrivermanager from now on

POM page object model is a design pattern in which we create object repository

-- architecture of framework --

    -- utils - to keep all the utilities of our pproject such as constants, config reader
            common methods etc to reuse them

    -- steps - all steps definitions can be found under this package for the gherkin steps
            we used in feature file

    -- pages - POM - to implement object repository and functions.

    -- runner class - we use this class execute all of our test cases

For pre condition and post condition in cucumber we have 2 annotations
-- Hooks

    -- @Before -- use for pre condition
    -- @After -- use for post condition

-- hooks should always be mentioned under steps package
