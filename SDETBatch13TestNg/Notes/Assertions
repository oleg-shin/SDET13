Assertions:
    We are not using if else condition because even if the test cae fails(i.e. the condition doesn't pass in if)
    the testNG will still show it has passed
    in order to overcome that we use
    assertion from testNg
    the library is assert
    and we call different types of assertions from it

    1) HardAssertions
         As soon as any assertion FAILS it doesnt check for other assertions
         marks the test as failed and quits

        Assert.assertEquals(Expected value, Actual Value); Assert.assertEquals(String,String);
            it compares two string if they are equal test case passed else fails
            --> if they are equal your test case will pass
            --> if they are not - it is going to fail
        Assert.assertTrue(boolean)
            --> if the boolean is True the assertion will pass
            --> if the boolean is false the assertion will fail

    2.SoftAssertions:
        Soft asseertion will execute all assertions that are there despite of the fact that they FAIL or PASS
        and once it has evaluated them all then it will mark the test case as
        Failed or Passed
        (it marks it failed even if one assertion has failed)
        The advantage of using soft asssert is that we can
        see what errors we are having in other assertions that we make in the same test case
        but we cant see them if we use hardassertion as IT WILL EXIT AS SOON AS THE FIRST ASSERTION FAILS
        method to implement:
            1. delcare the instance
            softAssert soft =new softAssert();
            2.make assertions
            soft.assertEquals();
            3. at the end of makiing all assertions
            you must do
            soft.assertALL()
            this evalutes wether the test case has to be marked passed or failed
